Revision 0.0.5a
---------------

- Integer BER codec at reworked fixing negative values encoding bug.
- Adjustments to make it running on Python 1.5 (tests don't work
  probably because of different repr() of binary string constants)
- clone() and subtype() methods of ASN.1 classes now accept optional
  cloneValueFlag flag which controls original value inheritance. The
  default is *not* to inherit original value for performance reasons
  (this may affect backward compatibility).
  Performance penalty may be huge on deeply nested Constructed objects
  re-creation.
- Bugfix to Constraints use as mapping keys.
- Bugfix to Integer & BitString clone() methods
- Minor performance optimization of TagSet.isSuperTagSetOf() method
- Bugix to the way to distinguish Set from SetOf at CER/DER SetOfEncoder
